|“I wanted a wireless monitor to constantly measure temp and humidity in my garage because I store chemicals, paints, etc that are somewhat sensitive to temp extremes. In addition, humidity monitoring helped me assess impact to flash times for automobile ceramic coating application. This monitor has been in place for a couple of months and works great. I have found it be very reliable. <p> <p> I would have liked some type of mounting bracket, but that’s my only complaint. Super easy to set up and the mobile app is easy to use, while providing a lot of trending data.”| 1. It's reliable and lasts at least a couple of months (Explicit). <p><p>2. The device should include a mounting bracket to ensure easy placement (Latent).<p><p>3. Can be placed in several different locations for a variety of uses (Latent).|
|“Temp. monitor does effective job and App is easy to navigate. Temp. was accurate within 1-2°, which is fine for its intended purpose.<p><p>Worked great w/ Bluetooth, but the Wi-Fi connection was not reliable. The only reason I got this was remote monitoring, so reliable wifi is critical.<p><p>After attempting to resolve my difficulty without success, Govee Cust Service suggested a full refund and promptly refunded my purchase. Great Cust. Svce.”| 1. The included/linked app is easy to navigate and use (Explicit). <p><p> 2. Accurate readings, within tolerable error (Explicit). <p><p> 3. To use the wifi function an additional purchase of compatible Router must be purchased (Latent).|
|“So at first I bought the cheaper Bluetooth models and really enjoyed those. I got this one because it has both Bluetooth and wifi, which means I can check temps at home even when I'm traveling. This is useful because I always turn the thermostat to a super eco-friendly setting while I'm gone, but if the outside temps are mild I might not have to make any adjustments before I get home. Also, as of the time of this writing, it's been 6 months and I haven't had to change the battery. The app is good too, it had no issues finding new thermometers when I bought extra, and they all fit on one screen. I have one outside and 6 inside, 3 wifi, and 4 Bluetooth only. Very happy with the products.”| 1. Works better than cheaper alternatives on the market (Explicit).<p><p>2. Battery efficient and able to last long periods without needing to replace batteries (Explicit).<p><p>3. The device is compatible with multiple of similar products. No need to work around having multiple apps or controllers (Latent).|

|“It worked flawlessly for the first 45 days. When the device is connected to WiFi, it works great. The problem is that if it loses its connection, it does not automatically reconnect. You have to get within Bluetooth range to manually reconnect it. After about 45 days and after the return period, it started dropping the WiFi connection about every day or two. As my device was purchased to monitor temperatures in my cabin in a different state, I am not able to get quality use from it, and now I can’t return it either.”| 1. When the device loses connection with the user's wifi or Bluetooth it is difficult to reconnect. (Explicit) <p><p>2. After some time the device's connection to the user’s preferred means of connection will drop. (Explicit)<p><p>3. Is not a good solution to monitoring areas from large distances. (Latent)|
|“I have had 4 of these since late last year and all 4 are now garbage. I purchased them for my temp and permanent greenhouse, my dad’s greenhouse, and to monitor my indoor grow room. They work great for the first couple months, but much more than that they just start reading erratic temps, refuse to connect via Bluetooth or wifi, and corrode like crazy. I’ve emailed tech support repeatedly for the first two I was trying to troubleshoot them and literally all they wrote back each time is “have you changed the batteries?” Yes I changed the batteries repeatedly. I removed them from the Govee app and re-set them up repeatedly. After trying to troubleshoot with the Govee support team for those 2 I just quit bothering. They clearly do not understand English well enough to understand the very thorough responses I was giving them explaining the multitudinous different troubleshooting attempts I’d made before I even tried to get them involved. Number 1 started throwing crazy temps and going off line while IN my house, where the temp never got above 80 and the humidity never got above 70%. Number 2 started reading 265° in my greenhouse, then dropped to 32°, then to 165° when I brought it inside to check and change the batteries. Number 3’s back panel melted even though the greenhouse never rose above 105, and number 4, in the pic, was wet inside and corroded even though the hatch was hatch side down on a metal grate with wide slats so that it would never be in standing water.”| 1. After a period of time the devices will quit working. Short life span. (Explicit)<p><p> 2. Physical device was easily worn out over time and as a result, compromised the functionality of the device. (Latent) <p><p> 3. Inconsistent reading of the same area between different devices within that one area. (Explicit)|
|“The battery life is about 3-4 months when using the 30 minute update intervals.<p><p>The app for this sensor, called Govee Home, is the primary detractor. It requires excessive permissions for what it does. Even after setup, the app still requires permanent access to precise location as well as access to detect nearby devices via Bluetooth and WiFi. This is an unnecessary privacy invasion. There is no reason for this app to need my exact location to tell me the temperature where the sensor is located, which is a completely different location! Without both of these permissions the app will not allow ANY access to any of it's interfaces. The only way I've found to bypass this is to add a widget to the home screen and rely on that for reading the temperature and never going back into the app. <p><p>I've since uninstalled the app and gave the sensor away.”| 1. Device required excessive and somewhat invasion information to operate. (Explicit)<p><p>2. The device has access to other near by Bluetooth or wifi devices, causing security concerns for the user. (Explicit)<p><p>3. The app is difficult to set up in a way that a user desires. No flexibility with the information “required” for the device to operate. (Latent)|

|“I’m using the temp sensors in both the kitchen refrigerator and its freezer. They are really easy to setup and the bluetooth signal is pretty good even through the metal sides of the refrigerator. I like the logging and graph feature of the app that lets me see how the refrigerator is performing. I was looking for a way to monitor the fridge when we are away so we have a good information if there’s a power outage to see how warm the fridge gets and for how long. This way we can decide if the food is likely still safe or should be tossed”| 1. Easy to set up and place around the user’s desired locations. (Explicit) <p><p>2.

Great app with a day, week, month view. I didnt realize my refrigerator cools every 2.5 hrs and varies in temp by 5-6 degrees. I will use for mult purposes. Love it. Going to get another”| 1. A bit pricy when compared to other devices on the market. (Explicit) <p><p> 2. A built-in alert system is included in this device to ensure that the user is notified when there is a problem. (Explicit) <p><p> 3. Entices users to buy more products of this kind by providing users with a positive first experience. (Latent)|
|“These are so convenient if you also have the gateway. I love the notification feature, though it’s not always 100% reliable. We recently went on a trip and I flipped off the breaker to the garage door openers not remembering that the freezer was on the same circuit. I got prompt notification in time to have somebody go over and turn the breaker back on. I just wish it supported home automation so I could automatically turn things on or off based on the temperature. The developers talked about implementing that a couple of years back, but I guess it’s not a high priority. Still, overall an excellent product. I’m up to 17 sensors and 4 gateways now. No problems displaying them all in the app.”| 1. The alert system works even when the user is a great distance away from the device. (Explicit)<p><p>2. In future models, it would be useful if the user was able to access the thermostat from the same device. Have the device be more all-inclusive. (Latent)<p><p>3. The app included with the device can run multiple devices and able to control them simultaneously. (Explicit)|

|“The SensorPush HT1, while promising seamless integration with smartphones, leaves much to be desired. Its reliance on bluetooth severely limits its range, making it less versatile for larger spaces or when monitoring areas from a distance. Additionally, the requirement of a separate hub for extended functionality feels like an unnecessary complication and an added expense. For a device that's meant to provide convenience, it ends up feeling rather restrictive. Also, Its hardware design doesn't convey a sense of sturdiness, raising concerns about its longevity and durability.”| 1. The Bluetooth function is dependent on the controlling device to be in range. (Explicit)<p><p>2. To control this device via wifi an additional purchase of a compatible route must be made, raising the overall price. (Explicit)<p><p>3. The structure of the device doesn’t meet users' standards for a device that is supposed to be placed and left. (Explicit)|
|“Seems like this device gets inaccurate when exposed to direct sunlight due to the radiant heating of the device. It records far above what the actual ambient temperature is at least from my testing. In order to get closer to accurate measurements, I need to have it shaded.”| 1.Device is depend of optimal positioning, can easily be manipulated by external factors. (Latent) <p><p> 2. The device requires a trial period to ensure that the device is located to ensure that it provides accurate reading. (Explicit) <p><p> 3. This device only works in areas that are contianed/ not exposed to external factors. Device is not adaptable. (Latent)|
|“It's been over 4 years since I purchased this item and it has worked well with reasonable accuracy. I have used it to monitor the temperature and humidity in a climate-controlled storage room that I rent to store things that I do not have room for in my house. This device has a rubbery texture to it that is similar to what you would find on inexpensive binoculars, spotting scopes, etc. to help with grip. This texture has now become an incredible sticky mess! Everything sticks to it. It is impossible to clean, and you definitely do not want to handle it because it is so sticky. I don't know if the newer devices also have this rubbery coating, but if so, there is a pretty good chance it will become a sticky mess also. There is no reason to have put this coating on something like this. It serves no practical purpose and probably added to the cost. There are other options for a better price”| 1. Though it has a long life span, it doesn’t last as long as the device should based on the price. (Latent)<p><p>2. The device after extended use begins to disintegrate and creates a mess. (Explicit)<p><p>3. There are better and more cost efficient alternatives on the market. Not worth the cost. (Explicit)|

|“This indoor-outdoor thermometer, brand name KJCOOSWI (I think they just drop a bag of Scrabble letters and pick out 8), has what I had been looking for: an easy-to-read display and the ability to locate the exterior sensor on the other side of my house. I’ve had an indoor-outdoor thermometer display unit for a long time which has been fine except for the external sensor which has to be mounted close by which has ended up being high off the ground. Changing the batteries has been a challenge. So, the KJCOOSWI looked like it was worth looking into. And it does seem to work very well. With this unit the outdoor sensor can be up to 100 meters away and while I don’t need to test that I did put the sensor outside at the other end of the house and the indoor display unit picks it up with no problem. It seems that current units like this have small-ish display units and it is important to me to be able to see the temperatures from across the room. It’s also important to be able to see the display with whatever ambient light is around. The KJCOOSWI unit gets around both of those requirements with an “Always On” backlight option. And it works very well. The way it works is with an external power supply, but not something proprietary – rather it will work with whatever USB power you have along with a, supplied, USB-C cable. And it works great! The backlight is just bright enough so you can see the display from pretty much any angle. Since it’s Always On it is on at night but it’s not disturbingly bright. Just a warm, blue-ish glow. You can really consider it a bit of a night light. As far as I can tell it is accurate. Since we still have the old unit I can compare them and they are one degree apart for the outdoor temperature, day or night. Seems odd but I can live with one degree difference. The KJCOOSWI thermometer will keep track of min-max temperature reading but since there is no option for date and time you won’t know when that was and that’s ok with me. I’m quite happy with this indoor-outdoor thermometer and display. It seems accurate and the backlit display means I don’t have to get right up to it or push a button to see what’s going on with the temperatures. Recommended.”| 1. Easy to read the display from across the room without needing to press a button. (Explicit)<p><p>2. “Always On” option for the display doesn’t need to bother the customer even if it is left on during the night. (Explicit)<p><p>3. Needs to be able to update the readings so the customer can have an accurate reading for that specific time of the day. (Latent)|
|“I like this weather station. I think it's atheistically pleasing and the size works well for me. I can read it from across the room but it doesn't take up a ton of space. I really appreciate that the base can be plugged into a power source or used with batteries and that there is a simple backlight on/off option. I still have to try to remember how to dress as the seasons change but at least I am a step ahead by knowing what the weather really is. I like knowing the highs and lows for the plants outside and it's very easy to see them and to clear them. It's just a push or two of a button and not a menu I have to page through, which is a thoughtful design feature. I had to move the outdoor sensor around a bit to find a good place for a reading but once I got it right, I was set. So far everything seems to be accurate and in agreement with my other more simple thermometer/humidity gauges and the weather apps. The outside humidity and pressure are a step-up for me and one less thing I need to look-up on my phone which is also very much appreciated. I am curious to see how long the batteries last, especially in colder temperatures. (I am anticipating replacing the outdoor batteries with rechargeable ones as I know the more extreme temperatures tend to drain them faster.) Overall I really like this Weather Station and as long it keeps working as it is currently, I will be happy. ”| 1.Can be plugged into a power source or used with batteries. (Explicit) <p><p> 2. Must say the max and min temperature. (Explicit)<p><p> 3. Needs to resist extreme temperatures for the sensors located in the outdoors. (Latent)|
|“This is a nice replacement at a lower price, and it also reads humidity and barometric pressure. I admit to being somewhat of an instrument aficionado (or maybe junkie) but I always check these devices for accuracy and have a little annoyance about unnecessary resolution, in this case temperature readings to 0.1 degree when the accuracy is much lower. I checked the indoor and outdoor sensors against each other and they read about 1 degree different, both within a degree of a lab mercury thermometer. That’s certainly good enough. There is no easy way for me to check the humidity measurement, but for that I really only have to know when to turn on my humidifier. The barometer is really a plus and seems to be very accurate. My old aneroid barometer has become unreliable and although i really don’t need to read the local pressure since an airport weather station is a few miles from my house it’s still fun to watch when a storm comes through. This one is surprisingly accurate, reading within 0.02 mm of Hg after correcting for altitude. All in allll, this is a nice weather station for my desk. I mounted the outside sensor in a somewhat sheltered location and it transmits about 50 feet through two walls. As long as it lasts I’ll be happy.”| 1. It needs to transmit without difficulty through walls. (Explicit)<p><p>2. Must have an accuracy of +/- 0.5 degrees (Latent)<p><p>3. Must be easy to mount and dismount either in a desk or a wall.

But this unit shows 16% I have only had it on for 3 hours, so I'll give it until tomorrow morning and perhaps a third reset (take out the batteries and install fresh ones) before sending it back.

|“The product seems to work well and the price is pretty good. There are a couple of minor and one major improvements that would help make this product great. The minor issues are related to instructions and display. The instructions were easy to follow. However they were hard to read and would benefit from being larger. They do provide a downloadable PDF copy, that does help when you find the link. The other display improvement would be to have a better trend indicator or to the meaning. The biggest deficiency is that the station allows for connecting other sensors. However, there does not seem to be a way to purchase additional sensors or a version that comes with more than one remote sensor. The seller does make comments that other sensors can be purchased at their store. However, none are displayed or referenced for an additional purchase. I purchased the system to see how it would initially work and I thought the price would allow me to test things out. After I got it set up, I was pleased and wanted to expand my monitoring. However, I can't obtain additional sensors.”| 1. Device must be able to work with an universal set of sensors rather than just a specific one. (Latent)<p><p>2.

**Description:**

A simple, easy-to-assemble three-wheeled car with many holes and places to attach additional sensors and circuitry. This simple chassis runs off of four double AA batteries and has encoders for distance and velocity measurements. The swivel wheel enables a simple turn-in-place motion for easy navigation and manipulation.

|“I used this to make a robot car for my niece. Great kit! Note that in the video I have the motor speed varying according to distance ahead, it's been limited to between 50% and 65%, movement is autonomous, and I used another acrylic plate from a second kit as a topper. I had no problems at 100%, but this was for a child.”| 1. Adjustable motor speed (Explicit)<p><p>2. Electronics are easily covered (Explicit)<p><p>3. Hard for children to use (Latent)|
|“I used the car platform, added the Arduino and sensor modules, programmed them, and made my own robot car. The Arduino and motor controller boards are great for this car. I put them together and found that they are quite coordinated. I recently used my Arduino card to test and control the robot car to make it run and succeed. I was worried at the beginning that my card would be incompatible with this car, and now it seems that it can be done. This time I bought the 2 wheels . 2 wheels gives me the feeling that I will try several models. Overall, this car is very good, can be compatible with my Arduino card, if you want to try to make a robot car, you can buy this car to try, chassis and color, as well as the size is suitable. recommend”| 1.

|“If you are looking for an inexpensive platform to use for your electronics project, this is a reasonable choice. It is important though to understand the limitations. These are gear motors. That means you will not be able to precisely start or stop them. In fact you'll have to move the vehicle at a fairly fast rate to overcome static friction. The pivot wheel will not move as freely as you like. So sometimes your vehicle will consistently turn to the left as you move forward, and sometimes to the left with the exact same power settings. Neither end is wide enough to mount multiple sonars, so if you want collision avoidance for multiple angles, you will have to get creative. The motors sit rather low, so you cannot drive across anything other than nicely paved surfaces. There are no screws attaching the wheels, so they will tend to fall off after lots of turns. My son used this for a mobile sonar platform. It was an adequate choice. But he would have been better of with something round using step motors. Then he could have had sonars in all directions and rotated the vehicle rather than rotating a sonar on-top. His collision avoidance would have worked at all angles, and he could have precisely programmed the movements of the vehicle. Instead he went with timed operations, which means the best he could do for a 90 degree turn is +/- 10 degrees. He can still add a gyroscope to compensate, but it is a much more complicated design.”| 1. Cheap parts to modify (Explicit)<p><p>2. Easy to program motors (Explicit)<p><p>3.

|“In theory this little fella is the most bang for your buck. Chasis, 2 motors with encoders, battery box, and beefy wheels look great online but in person lacks punch I expected. Adding to that, the chasis was partially cracked (super glued), one of the motor mounts snapped when installing (super glue, again), instructions were translated horribly, came with way too many extra screws which made using quantities to make heads or tails of which screw and nut went where, and a holes not lining up here and there makes me regret this purchase. Would send back if shipping wouldn't cost half the purchase price.”| 1. Cheap parts aren’t useful (Latent)<p><p>2. Weak parts aren’t useful (Explicit)<p><p>3.
