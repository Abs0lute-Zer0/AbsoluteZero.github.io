|“I wanted a wireless monitor to constantly measure temp and humidity in my garage because I store chemicals, paints, etc that are somewhat sensitive to temp extremes. In addition, humidity monitoring helped me assess impact to flash times for automobile ceramic coating application. This monitor has been in place for a couple of months and works great. I have found it be very reliable. <p> <p> I would have liked some type of mounting bracket, but that’s my only complaint. Super easy to set up and the mobile app is easy to use, while providing a lot of trending data.”| 1. It's reliable and lasts at least a couple of months (Explicit). <p><p>2. The device should include a mounting bracket to ensure easy placement (Latent).<p><p>3. Can be placed in several different locations for a variety of uses (Latent).|
|“Temp. monitor does effective job and App is easy to navigate. Temp. was accurate within 1-2°, which is fine for its intended purpose.<p><p>Worked great w/ Bluetooth, but the Wi-Fi connection was not reliable. The only reason I got this was remote monitoring, so reliable wifi is critical.<p><p>After attempting to resolve my difficulty without success, Govee Cust Service suggested a full refund and promptly refunded my purchase. Great Cust. Svce.”| 1. The included/linked app is easy to navigate and use (Explicit). <p><p> 2. Accurate readings, within tolerable error (Explicit). <p><p> 3. To use the wifi function an additional purchase of compatible Router must be purchased (Latent).|
|“So at first I bought the cheaper Bluetooth models and really enjoyed those. I got this one because it has both Bluetooth and wifi, which means I can check temps at home even when I'm traveling. This is useful because I always turn the thermostat to a super eco-friendly setting while I'm gone, but if the outside temps are mild I might not have to make any adjustments before I get home. Also, as of the time of this writing, it's been 6 months and I haven't had to change the battery. The app is good too, it had no issues finding new thermometers when I bought extra, and they all fit on one screen. I have one outside and 6 inside, 3 wifi, and 4 Bluetooth only. Very happy with the products.”| 1. Works better than cheaper alternatives on the market (Explicit).<p><p>2. Battery efficient and able to last long periods without needing to replace batteries (Explicit).<p><p>3. The device is compatible with multiple of similar products. No need to work around having multiple apps or controllers (Latent).|

|“It worked flawlessly for the first 45 days. When the device is connected to WiFi, it works great. The problem is that if it loses its connection, it does not automatically reconnect. You have to get within Bluetooth range to manually reconnect it. After about 45 days and after the return period, it started dropping the WiFi connection about every day or two. As my device was purchased to monitor temperatures in my cabin in a different state, I am not able to get quality use from it, and now I can’t return it either.”| 1. When the device loses connection with the user's wifi or Bluetooth it is difficult to reconnect. (Explicit) <p><p>2. After some time the device's connection to the user’s preferred means of connection will drop. (Explicit)<p><p>3. Is not a good solution to monitoring areas from large distances. (Latent)|
|“I have had 4 of these since late last year and all 4 are now garbage. I purchased them for my temp and permanent greenhouse, my dad’s greenhouse, and to monitor my indoor grow room. They work great for the first couple months, but much more than that they just start reading erratic temps, refuse to connect via Bluetooth or wifi, and corrode like crazy. I’ve emailed tech support repeatedly for the first two I was trying to troubleshoot them and literally all they wrote back each time is “have you changed the batteries?” Yes I changed the batteries repeatedly. I removed them from the Govee app and re-set them up repeatedly. After trying to troubleshoot with the Govee support team for those 2 I just quit bothering. They clearly do not understand English well enough to understand the very thorough responses I was giving them explaining the multitudinous different troubleshooting attempts I’d made before I even tried to get them involved. Number 1 started throwing crazy temps and going off line while IN my house, where the temp never got above 80 and the humidity never got above 70%. Number 2 started reading 265° in my greenhouse, then dropped to 32°, then to 165° when I brought it inside to check and change the batteries. Number 3’s back panel melted even though the greenhouse never rose above 105, and number 4, in the pic, was wet inside and corroded even though the hatch was hatch side down on a metal grate with wide slats so that it would never be in standing water.”| 1. After a period of time the devices will quit working. Short life span. (Explicit)<p><p> 2. Physical device was easily worn out over time and as a result, compromised the functionality of the device. (Latent) <p><p> 3. Inconsistent reading of the same area between different devices within that one area. (Explicit)|
|“The battery life is about 3-4 months when using the 30 minute update intervals.<p><p>The app for this sensor, called Govee Home, is the primary detractor. It requires excessive permissions for what it does. Even after setup, the app still requires permanent access to precise location as well as access to detect nearby devices via Bluetooth and WiFi. This is an unnecessary privacy invasion. There is no reason for this app to need my exact location to tell me the temperature where the sensor is located, which is a completely different location! Without both of these permissions the app will not allow ANY access to any of it's interfaces. The only way I've found to bypass this is to add a widget to the home screen and rely on that for reading the temperature and never going back into the app. <p><p>I've since uninstalled the app and gave the sensor away.”| 1. Device required excessive and somewhat invasion information to operate. (Explicit)<p><p>2. The device has access to other near by Bluetooth or wifi devices, causing security concerns for the user. (Explicit)<p><p>3. The app is difficult to set up in a way that a user desires. No flexibility with the information “required” for the device to operate. (Latent)|

|“I’m using the temp sensors in both the kitchen refrigerator and its freezer. They are really easy to setup and the bluetooth signal is pretty good even through the metal sides of the refrigerator. I like the logging and graph feature of the app that lets me see how the refrigerator is performing. I was looking for a way to monitor the fridge when we are away so we have a good information if there’s a power outage to see how warm the fridge gets and for how long. This way we can decide if the food is likely still safe or should be tossed”| 1. Easy to set up and place around the user’s desired locations. (Explicit) <p><p>2. Strong connection via Bluetooth, even working through metal paneling. (Explicit)<p><p>3. Provides the user with a variety of different types of results making it easy to understand and adapt to the user’s desires. (Latent)|
|“This device is awesome. A little more than I wanted to spend but worth it. Tracks temp, humidity, other right on your cell phone. It sends you alerts when a min or max you set is breached. Great app with a day, week, month view. I didnt realize my refrigerator cools every 2.5 hrs and varies in temp by 5-6 degrees. I will use for mult purposes. Love it. Going to get another”| 1. A bit pricy when compared to other devices on the market. (Explicit) <p><p> 2. A built-in alert system is included in this device to ensure that the user is notified when there is a problem. (Explicit) <p><p> 3. Entices users to buy more products of this kind by providing users with a positive first experience. (Latent)|
|“These are so convenient if you also have the gateway. I love the notification feature, though it’s not always 100% reliable. We recently went on a trip and I flipped off the breaker to the garage door openers not remembering that the freezer was on the same circuit. I got prompt notification in time to have somebody go over and turn the breaker back on. I just wish it supported home automation so I could automatically turn things on or off based on the temperature. The developers talked about implementing that a couple of years back, but I guess it’s not a high priority. Still, overall an excellent product. I’m up to 17 sensors and 4 gateways now. No problems displaying them all in the app.”| 1. The alert system works even when the user is a great distance away from the device. (Explicit)<p><p>2. In future models, it would be useful if the user was able to access the thermostat from the same device. Have the device be more all-inclusive. (Latent)<p><p>3. The app included with the device can run multiple devices and able to control them simultaneously. (Explicit)|

|“The SensorPush HT1, while promising seamless integration with smartphones, leaves much to be desired. Its reliance on bluetooth severely limits its range, making it less versatile for larger spaces or when monitoring areas from a distance. Additionally, the requirement of a separate hub for extended functionality feels like an unnecessary complication and an added expense. For a device that's meant to provide convenience, it ends up feeling rather restrictive. Also, Its hardware design doesn't convey a sense of sturdiness, raising concerns about its longevity and durability.”| 1. The Bluetooth function is dependent on the controlling device to be in range. (Explicit)<p><p>2. To control this device via wifi an additional purchase of a compatible route must be made, raising the overall price. (Explicit)<p><p>3. The structure of the device doesn’t meet users' standards for a device that is supposed to be placed and left. (Explicit)|
|“Seems like this device gets inaccurate when exposed to direct sunlight due to the radiant heating of the device. It records far above what the actual ambient temperature is at least from my testing. In order to get closer to accurate measurements, I need to have it shaded.”| 1.Device is depend of optimal positioning, can easily be manipulated by external factors. (Latent) <p><p> 2. The device requires a trial period to ensure that the device is located to ensure that it provides accurate reading. (Explicit) <p><p> 3. This device only works in areas that are contianed/ not exposed to external factors. Device is not adaptable. (Latent)|
|“It's been over 4 years since I purchased this item and it has worked well with reasonable accuracy. I have used it to monitor the temperature and humidity in a climate-controlled storage room that I rent to store things that I do not have room for in my house. This device has a rubbery texture to it that is similar to what you would find on inexpensive binoculars, spotting scopes, etc. to help with grip. This texture has now become an incredible sticky mess! Everything sticks to it. It is impossible to clean, and you definitely do not want to handle it because it is so sticky. I don't know if the newer devices also have this rubbery coating, but if so, there is a pretty good chance it will become a sticky mess also. There is no reason to have put this coating on something like this. It serves no practical purpose and probably added to the cost. There are other options for a better price”| 1. Though it has a long life span, it doesn’t last as long as the device should based on the price. (Latent)<p><p>2. The device after extended use begins to disintegrate and creates a mess. (Explicit)<p><p>3. There are better and more cost efficient alternatives on the market. Not worth the cost. (Explicit)|
