## Power Source
| **Solution** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| BA-5800 Military Class Battery | -High Ah (7.5 Ah)<br/>-Durable | -Expensive ($49.99)<br/>-Heavy<br/>-Large |
| Rayovac 9V Battery | -Cheap ($2.25)<br/>-Popular<br/>-Small | -Low Ah (0.8 Ah)<br/>-Non-Rechargeable |
| 18650 Battery | -High Ah (2.2 Ah)<br/>-Popular<br/>-Rechargeable-Cheap ($2.40) | -Large<br/>-Requires Charger |

**Choice: Option 3 (18650 Battery)**
**Rationale:** Rechargeable with high amperage capable of delivering the appropriate voltage and current to all the components.

## Fuse
| **Solution** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| MFU0603FF01000P500 Fuse | -Handles up to 32V<br/>-1 Amp Limiter <br/>-Low Cost ($0.24)<br/>-Small (0603 Package) | -Hard to Replace<br/>-Blows out Quickly |
| ERB-RE2R00V Fuse | -Handles up to 32V<br/>-2 Amp Limiter<br/>-Low Cost ($0.27)<br/>-Small (0603 Package) | -Hard to Replace<br/>-Blows out Quickly |
| 0215002.MXP Fuse| -Handles up to 250V<br/>-2 Amp Limiter<br/>-Easy To Replace<br/>-Large | -Large<br/>-Requires Holder<br/>-Expensive |

**Choice: Option 3**
**Rationale:** This option is a reliable component with all the capabilities the team is looking for in terms of current limiting and circuit protection. While more expensive than the non-holder style fuses, the ability to quickly and easily replace this component is worth the extra expense in the eyes of the team. 

## DC Motor
| **Solution** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ROB-12429 Small Gearmotor | -Light (17.69 g)<br/>-Includes a gearbox (reduction ratio: 50)<br/>-Low Cost ($13.95)<br/>-Small (26 x 12 x 10mm)<br/>-Easy to attach to shaft (dent in the shaft) | -Small shaft length<br/>-Small mounting holes<br/>-Import Tariff |
| Planetary Gear Motors | -High torque (160mNm)<br/>-Low voltage (6V)<br/>-Easy to attach to shaft (dent in the shaft)<br/>Small (dia 16mm)<br/>-Mounting holes (M2) | -Expensive ($37.05)<br/>-Small shaft length |
| Sparkfun Motor | -Super Cheap ($1.20)<br/>-Low Voltage (7.2 V)<br/>-Gearbox (1:48) | -Large (70 mm x 36 mm)<br/>-Inconvenient shape<br/>-Small Shaft size|

**Choice: Option 1**
**Rationale:** We decided to go with the ROB-12429 DC Motor because it had a healthy balance between its size, weight, cost, and adaptability. It wasn’t too pricey for a quality DC motor, while still being small and lightweight. Its shaft design makes it easy to attach 3D-printed wheels and other 3D-printed components.

## Motor Driver
| **Solution** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| IFX9201SGAUMA1 | -Cheap ($4.00)<br/>-High voltages (40 V)<br/>-Dual Motor Driver (2 half h-bridges)<br/>-Small (7.8 mm x 10mm)<br/>-Easy to use | -Lots of extra pins (5/12 are used) |
| TC642EOA713 | -Cheap ($2.23)<br/>-Easy to use<br/>-No wasted pins | -Can only drive single motor |
