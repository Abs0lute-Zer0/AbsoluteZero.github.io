## Team Organization

### Charter

The team met up for the first team meeting to discuss the roles and responsibilities that each member would be expected to fulfill. Over an hour the team worked to write a charter that was agreeable to all members. Below is the result of this meeting.

Our primary goal is to foster a creative learning environment in which every team member has a plethora of opportunities to improve. Through collaborative efforts, another team goal is to improve the communication skills of every member. Furthermore, another goal is for every team member to gain proficiency in all engineering skills discussed and taught in the EGR 314 class. Moreover, another goal is to establish engineering connections to better our careers. Finally, our last goal is to produce a product that accomplishes its tasks with positive customer satisfaction.

### Mission Statement

The team desired to develop an appropriate and accurate mission statement for this project. The team wanted the mission statement to reflect not only the project but also the relations between team members.

Our teamâ€™s mission is to develop a portable weather station capable of displaying multiple weather data points connected to an external site. This device aims to provide users with important information about local meteorological conditions.

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

### User Needs

To better understand how to design a product of this type, the team worked together to come up with a list of possible user needs that would provide essential information to keep in mind when it came time to begin designing a device. The team determined that the target users would most likely be individuals/companies with an interest in their local weather or researchers. A sample of these user needs is listed below:

* Device needs to be affordable
* Needs to be easily assembled/repaired
* It needs to ensure effortless relocation
* Device needs to be simplistic in control to ensure user accessibility
* The data recorded needs to be reliable and accurate
* Needs to be durable and able to withstand the conditions it is testing in

For the full list of user needs, please go to [Appendix B: User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements](UserNeedsBenchmarking&Requirements.md)

### Voices of Customers (VOC) Benchmarking 

For this, the team decided to do some research on our main experts who would be meteorological experts as well as casual day-to-day customers. We looked at what information is important for both types of customers to know in an easy and fast manner. The main data that was important for our customers to know was: the temperature forecast (with a maximum and minimum value), the humidity outside, and a reasonable weather prediction. This way the user can receive a notification to their phone so that way they can get ready for their day while taking into consideration the weather forecast.

**Process of Creating User Needs:**
To find the required needs for the device and facilitate organizing the ideas into their categories, the team first brainstormed the needs of the customers based on what we felt the user would care about the most. Initially, the ideas were unrelated but after some work many themes were realized. The team then continued to expand on each theme with the required needs being centered around any potential users.

**Conversion of User Needs into Specifications:**
With every user need falling under a particular category, the team understood whether each user need was quantifiable or qualitative. After this analysis, it was easy to determine how the user needs would fall into a certain specification and what was needed for the final product. As an example, safety specifications were the first to be identified based on the assumed user needs which was used as a basis to convert other user needs to other specifications. 

**Assessment Based on Product Requirements/Aspects:**
The final product's design will be thoroughly assessed on all product aspects as they are all crucial. Safety and functionality will of course be given the most importance of assessment as that signifies a successful or failed product. Of course, there will be many places for improvement after the initial final product so therefore the customizability and manufacturability won't be assessed as heavily but should still be kept in mind when designing the final product. Finally, user experience is. After the safety, functionality, user experience, customizability, and manufacturability product aspects are assessed, the product will be deemed to be either successful or incomplete. Following the final assessment, expandability will be looked at to consider if the product can considered for further improvements. These assessments and checks will determine if the final design meets the product requirements. 


### Compiled List of Ideas

DELETE LATER "Include a brief description of how you came up with these ideas, then include a short list of the top ideas that you came up with"

## Design Ideation

**Team Idea Generation:**
The team felt it was best to first identify several big themes of ideas like safety features and sensor features and then brainstorm features that can fit each category. After writing any big concepts, every person expanded on an assigned concept and generated as many ideas as they could. 

**Brainstorming:**
Initially, the team planned on blindly generating lots of ideas but later on it was discovered that generating features based on pre-planned categories proved to be more efficient. Of course, there is a limitation to potential ideas if the categories have to be pre-planned and therefore the team thought it was best to also include free-flowing ideas that may not fall under any category. 

**Organization and Ranking Process:**
After all the ideas were generated, the team discussed what type of features were most important based on the categories that we thought of during the user needs generation section. As expected, the safety and functionality features were given high importance in a similar order of importance as previously stated in the user needs section.
