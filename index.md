## Introduction

This project aims to create a functioning mobile weather station that users can use to receive relevant and accurate environmental readings. The core meteorological readings that this device aims to collect are humidity and temperature. This device must additionally fulfill all class requirements for this project to be considered a success. This means including a custom-chosen PIC, communicating with the user over wifi, and having a motor controlled using SPI/I2C. The team worked to derive a method of formulation/brainstorming to encourage creative thinking to ensure that the final product is a good representation of the values and requirements of the team and the class. The team additionally, included the rover capabilities as an added challenge to the project. The team hopes that this project will better their understanding of robotics, circuit work, and coding in general.

## Team Organization

### Charter

The team met up for the first team meeting to discuss the roles and responsibilities that each member would be expected to fulfill. Over an hour the team worked to write a charter that was agreeable to all members. Below is the result of this meeting.

Our primary goal is to foster a creative learning environment in which every team member has a plethora of opportunities to improve. Through collaborative efforts, another team goal is to improve the communication skills of every member. Furthermore, another goal is for every team member to gain proficiency in all engineering skills discussed and taught in the EGR 314 class. Moreover, another goal is to establish engineering connections to better our careers. Finally, our last goal is to produce a product that accomplishes its tasks with positive customer satisfaction.

### Mission Statement

The team desired to develop an appropriate and accurate mission statement for this project. The team wanted the mission statement to reflect not only the project but also the relations between team members.

Our teamâ€™s mission is to develop a portable weather station capable of displaying multiple weather data points connected to an external site. This device aims to provide users with important information about local meteorological conditions.

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

### User Needs

To better understand how to design a product of this type, the team worked together to come up with a list of possible user needs that would provide essential information to keep in mind when it came time to begin designing a device. The team determined that the target users would most likely be individuals/companies with an interest in their local weather or researchers. A sample of these user needs is listed below:

* Device needs to be affordable
* Needs to be easily assembled/repaired
* It needs to ensure effortless relocation
* Device needs to be simplistic in control to ensure user accessibility
* The data recorded needs to be reliable and accurate
* Needs to be durable and able to withstand the conditions it is testing in

For the full list of user needs, please go to [Appendix B: User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements](UserNeedsBenchmarking&Requirements.md)

### Voices of Customers (VOC) Benchmarking 

For this, the team decided to do some research on our main experts who would be meteorological experts as well as casual day-to-day customers. We looked at what information is important for both types of customers to know in an easy and fast manner. The main data that was important for our customers to know was: the temperature forecast (with a maximum and minimum value), the humidity outside, and a reasonable weather prediction. This way the user can receive a notification to their phone so that way they can get ready for their day while taking into consideration the weather forecast.

Figure 3: Ranked Needs

**Process of Creating User Needs:**
To find the required needs for the device and facilitate organizing the ideas into their categories, the team first brainstormed the needs of the customers based on what we felt the user would care about the most. Initially, the ideas were unrelated but after some work many themes were realized. The team then continued to expand on each theme with the required needs being centered around any potential users.

**Conversion of User Needs into Specifications:**
With every user need falling under a particular category, the team understood whether each user need was quantifiable or qualitative. After this analysis, it was easy to determine how the user needs would fall into a certain specification and what was needed for the final product. As an example, safety specifications were the first to be identified based on the assumed user needs which was used as a basis to convert other user needs to other specifications. 

**Assessment Based on Product Requirements/Aspects:**
The final product's design will be thoroughly assessed on all product aspects as they are all crucial. Safety and functionality will of course be given the most importance of assessment as that signifies a successful or failed product. Of course, there will be many places for improvement after the initial final product so therefore the customizability and manufacturability won't be assessed as heavily but should still be kept in mind when designing the final product. Finally, user experience is. After the safety, functionality, user experience, customizability, and manufacturability of product aspects are assessed, the product will be deemed to be either successful or incomplete. Following the final assessment, expandability will be looked at to consider if the product can considered for further improvements. These assessments and checks will determine if the final design meets the product requirements. 


### Compiled List of Ideas

The team worked to sort and rank these needs based on the requirements of the project. Additionally, the team took into consideration the needs and requirements that users would also need for the project to be user-friendly and meet the criteria of the class.

Table 1: Short list of ranked project/customer needs

| Restated Customer Need (Explicit/Latent) | Meta Need | Ranking |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| Cost efficient | Functionality | 1 |
| Accurate | Functionality | 2 |
|barometer (measures atmospheric pressure)|Functionality|3|
|rigid body|Functionality|4|

## Design Ideation

**Team Idea Generation:**
The team felt it was best to first identify several big themes of ideas like safety features and sensor features and then brainstorm features that can fit each category. After writing any big concepts, every person expanded on an assigned concept and generated as many ideas as they could. 

**Brainstorming:**
Initially, the team planned on blindly generating lots of ideas but later on it was discovered that generating features based on pre-planned categories proved to be more efficient. Of course, there is a limitation to potential ideas if the categories have to be pre-planned and therefore the team thought it was best to also include free-flowing ideas that may not fall under any category. 

**Organization and Ranking Process:**
After all the ideas were generated, the team discussed what type of features were most important based on the categories that we thought of during the user needs generation section. As expected, the safety and functionality features were given high importance in a similar order of importance as previously stated in the user needs section. After the team settled on three design concepts each concept was sketched by a separate person. Jillian Brooke sketched the Weather Bug 2000 concept, Raj Kodithyala sketched the Motor Controlled Temperature Gauge concept, and Briana Wells sketched the Rover Weather Station concept.

For a more detailed explanation, please see [Appendix C: Design Ideation](DesignIdeation.md)

## Final Selected Design

![Final Design Concept](https://github.com/Abs0lute-Zer0/AbsoluteZero.github.io/assets/156485138/a75c8028-ddcb-4adc-b548-a1dbaf6c942a)

Figure 4: Final Selected Design

The Selected design illustrates the desired outcome for this project. The design includes a wheel system with an integrated controller to allow for users to control the trajectory of the device. Additionally, the device is centered around the temperature sensor and the humidity sensor which is related to a built-in alert system to notify users of dangerous conditions. If, for example, the temperature sensor detects a value that is deemed dangerous, such as 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or 40 Degrees Celcius, the device will raise a flag to warn the user. (The image depicts a scenario where the device has detected dangerous conditions). This device will work to ensure user safety with up-to-date readings communicated over wifi via the ESP32. NOTE: Controller and cord not drawn to scale. 

This design was chosen as the team was interested in a mobile weather station. The team believed that a mobile weather station would be more useful as it could easily move to other locations to check the weather there. The team picked this design over the Weather Bug 2000 because we believe the overall shape and the large wheels would be better suited for the outdoor environment and easier to manufacture.


## Block Diagram

Figure 5: Block Diagram

The requirements for this project were a key consideration for the team when it came time to designing subsystems and grouping them into appropriate groupings. The requirements for this project were that the system must include at least two separate serial sensors, which could include the following: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, or other modalities with instructors' approval. Additionally, the project must include at least one motor controlled by a motor controlled via I2C or SPI.

The team then worked to divide the work between group members to ensure that all subsystems had a team member working on each section. The subsystems were divided as follows: 
* Briana Wells: Microcontroller and ESP32
* Raj Kodithyala: Humidity Sensor and Movement system/motors
* Alex Gutierrez: SPI Motor Driver
* Jillian Brooke: Temperature Sensor and 3.3V Regulator

The Microcontroller and ESP32 Subsystems work to meet the requirement that the project must be able to communicate via wifi, to send the sensor data to the user. The humidity and temperature sensors work to fulfill the requirement to have at least two separate serial sensors, to measure the appropriate values in the device's environment. The SPI Motor Driver works to fulfill the requirement to include at least one motor controlled via I2C or SPI, used to raise a flag in the instance that the device detects environmental values that are deemed dangerous. Additionally, the extra Momenent system is an addition that the team decided to do to allow the device to traverse its environment.

## Hardware Implementation


### Final Schematic
![image](https://github.com/Abs0lute-Zer0/AbsoluteZero.github.io/assets/156540341/7f448416-66f7-40d8-9818-df94857a0c70)
Figure 6: Hardware Implementation

**Functionality**: The schematic features a temperature and humidity sensor to output weather station data to the MQTT server. It is set up to have a motor-controlled response utilizing a motor driver. Furthermore, the schematic contains four LEDs and a piezo buzzer. The motor will spin a flag and the buzzer will buzz when the temperature or humidity reads too high.

**Design and Decision-Making Process**: The team wanted to go beyond the standard project requirements. To further warn the user of extreme temperatures, a buzzer was implemented to provide an audio warning system. The motor is utilized to spin the flag providing a visual warning system. The combination of visual + audio warning systems will quickly alert the user to unsafe weather conditions. The motor will be provided with an external 9V power supply to sufficiently power and run the motor holding the flag. The LEDs provided in the circuit will turn on to indicate to the user that the system is powered up and fully functional.

**Version 2.0 Changes**: The main changes for version 2.0 occur on the PCB design. The components are currently spaced out, leaving a lot of empty space on the PCB. A smaller PCB design will allow a smaller construction of the final product making everything more compact. Some other minor changes include removing the wire mess on the final schematic. Replacing each wire with a symbol annotation will allow any viewer to easily identify the components and how everything is connected to the microcontroller. Another small change is to replace J15 with a piezo buzzer image so that the user that those two pins are connected to a piezo buzzer.

## Software Implementation

![Team304_SoftwareProposal_ drawio](https://github.com/Abs0lute-Zer0/AbsoluteZero.github.io/assets/156485138/a343fc5c-d782-4aae-ade5-c1c747d78305)

Figure 7: Software Proposal

For the software of this project, the team decided to set up the code in a way that after the system is initialized and interrupts are enabled, the program will check on the temperature of the area, using the respective sensor via I2C communication, and update the user on the current temperature. After that, if the temperature is above a certain margin, the microcontroller will send a signal to the motor via SPI for it to raise a flag to alert the user about the higher temperatures, this flag will stay up until the temperature has decreased to below the alert margin. Lastly, the humidity sensor will check the humidity of the area and send the information to the user via I2C. Additionally, there is a timer that increments by 1 second, every 10 seconds an interrupt (Blink) is sent. This interruption turns off the eye LEDs for 1 second, making the appearance of a blink.

The team decided to organize the process this way to optimize the functionality of the device and to ensure that the order of actions would be executed in a way that would optimize the mechanisms of the device. Additionally, organizing the functions in such a way, ensures that systems/functions do not over-lap and disrupt other actions of the device. 

### Top 5 Changes

Over the semester and subsequently the project, changes were taken to; ensure simple user input, the performance of the device, and the functionality of the code. In doing so 5 major changes were put in place to ensure such:

* Additional of an Interrupt: 
  * To ensure that the device followed the project guidelines and met all required sections, the team found that the inclusion of an interrupt was required. Initially, the team tried implementing an interrupt to the printing of the data, however, when this failed the team looked for other systems/functions to change. In doing so the team decided to implement an interrupt for every 10 seconds the LED eyes would "Blink", as described in the above diagram in the "Blink section". 
* Print via ESP32
  * When starting this project the team originally was going to have the information collected from the data be sent to the user via an OLED, however, the team quickly found issues with the OLED when doing an associated assignment. Additionally, the team then worked on an activity that worked to send information via wifi over the ESP32, such a function is described in the diagram above.
* Added a Timer Function:
  * As part of the interrupt the team needed to create a timer function that would increment according to the desired result. As such a time was created using the in-program functions and syntax.
* Separate the Sensor Functions:
  * To get the system to run with as few complications as possible the team worked to separate the sensor code, as in separating the two purposes into two separate in-code functions.
* Correct/Layout Function for Motor Driver
  * One of the biggest challenges for this project was the prospect of getting the motor driver function working. The final iteration of the software saw the use of counters and a separate function to successfully run the code, as seen in the above diagram.


### Areas of Improvement

One of the most important components of this project was the software which was used to execute the functions that the team desired for the project to execute. To formulate the code that was used in the final device, the team pulled from all of the in-class assignments and code practice that was required throughout the semester. Such as the temperature sensor code being pulled from the Advance Serial Communication ICC, along with the basis of the motor driver code. However, just pulling from the in-class work wasnâ€™t enough, the team also had to branch out and look for information in other ways, such as through networking and Microchip resources. If the team was presented with another opportunity to create the software design, there are a few improvements that the group could implement. One of the biggest improvements would have been to have started by improving the flow of the program. While the current iteration of the code is well written and works the flow of the user-defined functions may not be in an order that would be well understood by an external reviewer. Additionally, the code shouldâ€™ve included more notes on the function of each line and their relevance to the actions of the device. In future iterations, it would be desirable to see a function that prints the values exported to wifi via the ESP32 in a more visually appealing format. As for the organization of the code, it would follow a structure more similar to the flow of the software diagram. To improve the debuggability of the teamâ€™s current code, more notes should be included in the main while loop, in which the individual user-defined functions are called, to better label which functions to snooze when debugging others. If there was a way to have better controlled the motorâ€™s speed that would have been an improvement over the current model. Overall, throughout this project, the team has all grown in their understanding of software in PIC and are satisfied with the final product that was presented.

## Lessons Learned


Throughout this project the group had to learn multiple techniques and overcome multiple challenges in order to have a successful project. Most of the lessons that the team learned vary from team and work organization, to coding and hardware implementation.<p>
First, when embarking on the hardware aspect of the project, it was crucial to meticulously label every component and store them accordingly to prevent any loss of materials, in addition of this, it also helps when soldering the components in the PCB ensuring that every component is soldered in the correct place with the correct wiring. With that being said it takes us to the next lesson learned, testing.<p>
Before soldering components onto the main PCB, the team learnt the how testing on a breadboard and breakout boards is indispensable for the project to succeed. This preliminary step helps identify any potential issues or compatibility issues between components, allowing the team to make adjustments or modifications to the schematic and the code before soldering the PCB. Because of this, we also learnt about the importance of ordering extra parts of the components in order to have a surplus in case or any parts do not work. This lesson also helped on understandin the multiple communication methods with the microcontroller as well as to help test if the microcontroller can communicate with 2 different sensor while using the same pin.<p>
This bring to the next thing we were able to learn for the project. Finding a way for 2 different sensors to communicate via I2C using the exact same pins for the microcontroller. By doin this it helped us optimizing the resources available and simplifying the final deliverable.
Additionally, as stated previously, it was necessary to understand and learn how to communicate with the microcontroller using methods such as EUSART, I2C, and SPI. By understanding the way this methods work, we were able to have the microcontroller communicate with the sensors using I2C, the motor driver using SPI, and with the another microcontroller using EUSART.<p>
Another key lesson required was the soldering surface mount components. This skill was important for us to learn since it facilitates soldering the components in a more compact area compared with a thruhole soldering. Another lesson we learnt that helped us soldering with surface mount components was how to implement soldermask in a PCB to prevent any unwanted bridges or shorts.<p>
Incorporating WiFi connectivity allows for seamless data transmission and communication with the user was another topic that we had to learn in order to build the project. This capability enhances the usability and versatility of the device, enabling remote monitoring, control, and data exchange.<p>
Another of the things that we had comprehend and identify for this project was the differences between microcontrollers and find which would work best for the project to use. Factors such as processing power, memory, peripherals, and power consumption must be carefully considered to ensure optimal performance and efficiency.<p>
Lastly, creating a block diagram for an embedded system is indispensable for visualizing the system architecture and understanding the interconnections between various components. It serves as a roadmap for design and development, facilitating collaboration among team members and guiding the implementation process from concept to realization.

## Recommendations for Future Students

1. Students should familiarize themselves with the Cadence software and the general guidelines for PC design as it will be a key part of the class.
2. Students should familiarize themselves with Python syntax and how to use Thonny or Visual Studio Code since it wiil be key for the later ESP32 assignments in the class.
3. Students should work to stay ahead on the assignments and project in the course to give themselves more time for when issues eventually come up and take time to be resolved.
4. Students should work on their C programming skills as that is the main coding language used in the class. Specifically they should look at the format of C that MPLAB X IDE uses since that's the main programming application for the course.
5. Students should learn how to make and edit directories and files on GitHub since that is the place where all of the information on your project will to posted as your final report.
