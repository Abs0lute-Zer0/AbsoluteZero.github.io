## Team Organization

### Charter

DELETE LATER "Include connective tissue"

Our primary goal is to foster a creative learning environment in which every team member has a plethora of opportunities to improve. Through collaborative efforts, another team goal is to improve the communication skills of every member. Furthermore, another goal is for every team member to gain proficiency in all engineering skills discussed and taught in the EGR 314 class. Moreover, another goal is to establish engineering connections to better our careers. Finally, our last goal is to produce a product that accomplishes its tasks with positive customer satisfaction.

### Mission Statement

DELETE LATER "Include connective tissue"

Our teamâ€™s mission is to develop a portable weather station capable of displaying multiple weather data points connected to an external site. This device aims to provide users with important information about local meteorological conditions.

[Appendix A: Team Organization Charter](TeamOrganizationCharter.md)

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

### User Needs

In order to better understand how to design a product of this type, the team worked together to come up with a list of different possible user needs that would provide essential information to keep in mind when it came time to begin designing a device. The team determined that the target usre would most likely be individuals/companies with intrests in their local weather or researchers. A sample of these user needs is listed below:

* Device needs to be affordable
* Needs to be easily assembled/repared
* It needs to ensure effortless relocation
* Device needs to be simplistic in control to ensure user accessibility
* The data recorded needs to be relyable and accurate
* Needs to be durable and able to withstand the conditions it is testing in

For the the full list of user needs, please go to [Appendix B: User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements](UserNeedsBenchmarking&Requirements.md)

### Voices of Customers (VOC) Benchmarking 

CHANGE THIS IS ONLY REFERENCE "For this part, since the group was able to glean that many of the users of this product would be younger or children, the group investigated five different toys to see their pros, cons, and features as well as how the users reacted to them. the team used this to see what features users liked and what they disliked so that the team could get an idea of some more user needs that the team would need to cover in our product. With the feedback as well the team were able to understand consumers better and how to build a better product for them drawing from positives and negatives they said about other products."

For the list of searches done, please go to [Appendix B: User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements](UserNeedsBenchmarking&Requirements.md)

DELETE LATER "For example, how did your team organize, combine, and split needs into the list you arrived at? Justify the process by which your team assigned weights for importance, using both interview notes and internal team discussions."

**Grouped Needs:**

Insert Picture

DELETE LATER "Discuss the process by which your team converted user needs into specifications."

**Ranked Needs:**

Insert Picture

DELETE LATER "Discuss, with detail, how your design will be assessed according to the "aspects", to ensure your product meets your requirements."

### Compiled List of Ideas

DELETE LATER "Include a breif description of how you came up with thte ideas, then include a short list of the top ideads that you came up with"
