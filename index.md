## Team Organization

### Charter

The team met up for the first team meeting to discuss the roles and responsibilities that each member would be expected to fulfill. Over an hour the team worked to write a charter that was agreeable to all members. Below is the result of this meeting.

Our primary goal is to foster a creative learning environment in which every team member has a plethora of opportunities to improve. Through collaborative efforts, another team goal is to improve the communication skills of every member. Furthermore, another goal is for every team member to gain proficiency in all engineering skills discussed and taught in the EGR 314 class. Moreover, another goal is to establish engineering connections to better our careers. Finally, our last goal is to produce a product that accomplishes its tasks with positive customer satisfaction.

### Mission Statement

The team desired to develop an appropriate and accurate mission statement for this project. The team wanted the mission statement to reflect not only the project but also the relations between team members.

Our teamâ€™s mission is to develop a portable weather station capable of displaying multiple weather data points connected to an external site. This device aims to provide users with important information about local meteorological conditions.

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

### User Needs

To better understand how to design a product of this type, the team worked together to come up with a list of possible user needs that would provide essential information to keep in mind when it came time to begin designing a device. The team determined that the target users would most likely be individuals/companies with an interest in their local weather or researchers. A sample of these user needs is listed below:

* Device needs to be affordable
* Needs to be easily assembled/repaired
* It needs to ensure effortless relocation
* Device needs to be simplistic in control to ensure user accessibility
* The data recorded needs to be reliable and accurate
* Needs to be durable and able to withstand the conditions it is testing in

For the full list of user needs, please go to [Appendix B: User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements](UserNeedsBenchmarking&Requirements.md)

### Voices of Customers (VOC) Benchmarking 

For this, the team decided to do some research on our main experts who would be meteorological experts as well as casual day-to-day customers. We looked at what information is important for both types of customers to know in an easy and fast manner. The main data that was important for our customers to know was: the temperature forecast (with a maximum and minimum value), the humidity outside, and a reasonable weather prediction. This way the user can receive a notification to their phone so that way they can get ready for their day while taking into consideration the weather forecast.

### Documented Progress of Organized Statements

To find the required needs for the device and facilitate organizing the ideas into their categories, the team first brainstormed the needs of the customers based on what we felt the user would care about the most. Initially, the ideas were unrelated but after some work many themes were realized. The team then continued to expand on each theme with the required needs being centered around any potential users.

**Grouped Needs:**
