# Lessons Learned

Throughout this project the group had to learn multiple techniques and overcome multiple challenges in order to have a successful project. Most of the lessons that the team learned vary from team and work organization, to coding and hardware implementation.<p>
First, when embarking on the hardware aspect of the project, it was crucial to meticulously label every component and store them accordingly to prevent any loss of materials, in addition of this, it also helps when soldering the components in the PCB ensuring that every component is soldered in the correct place with the correct wiring. With that being said it takes us to the next lesson learned, testing.<p>
Before soldering components onto the main PCB, the team learnt the how testing on a breadboard and breakout boards is indispensable for the project to succeed. This preliminary step helps identify any potential issues or compatibility issues between components, allowing the team to make adjustments or modifications to the schematic and the code before soldering the PCB. Because of this, we also learnt about the importance of ordering extra parts of the components in order to have a surplus in case or any parts do not work. This lesson also helped on understandin the multiple communication methods with the microcontroller as well as to help test if the microcontroller can communicate with 2 different sensor while using the same pin.<p>
This bring to the next thing we were able to learn for the project. Finding a way for 2 different sensors to communicate via I2C using the exact same pins for the microcontroller. By doin this it helped us optimizing the resources available and simplifying the final deliverable.
Additionally, as stated previously, it was necessary to understand and learn how to communicate with the microcontroller using methods such as EUSART, I2C, and SPI. By understanding the way this methods work, we were able to have the microcontroller communicate with the sensors using I2C, the motor driver using SPI, and with the another microcontroller using EUSART.<p>
Another key lesson required was the soldering surface mount components. This skill was important for us to learn since it facilitates soldering the components in a more compact area compared with a thruhole soldering. Another lesson we learnt that helped us soldering with surface mount components was how to implement soldermask in a PCB to prevent any unwanted bridges or shorts.<p>
Incorporating WiFi connectivity allows for seamless data transmission and communication with the user was another topic that we had to learn in order to build the project. This capability enhances the usability and versatility of the device, enabling remote monitoring, control, and data exchange.<p>
Another of the things that we had comprehend and identify for this project was the differences between microcontrollers and find which would work best for the project to use. Factors such as processing power, memory, peripherals, and power consumption must be carefully considered to ensure optimal performance and efficiency.<p>
Lastly, creating a block diagram for an embedded system is indispensable for visualizing the system architecture and understanding the interconnections between various components. It serves as a roadmap for design and development, facilitating collaboration among team members and guiding the implementation process from concept to realization.
