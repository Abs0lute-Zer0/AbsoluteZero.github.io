## Final Selected Design

Figure 4: Final Selected Design

The Selected design illustrates the desired outcome for this project. The design includes a wheel system with an integrated controller to allow for users to control the trajectory of the device. Additionally, the device is centered around the temperature sensor and the humidity sensor which is related to a built-in alert system to notify users of dangerous conditions. If, for example, the temperature sensor detects a value that is deemed dangerous, such as 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or 40 Degrees Celcius, the device will raise a flag to warn the user. (The image depicts a scenario where the device has detected dangerous conditions). This device will work to ensure user safety with up-to-date readings communicated over wifi via the ESP32. NOTE: Controller and cord not drawn to scale. 

This design was chosen as the team was interested in a mobile weather station. The team believed that a mobile weather station would be more useful as it could easily move to other locations to check the weather there. The team picked this design over the Weather Bug 2000 because we believe the overall shape and the large wheels would be better suited for the outdoor environment and easier to manufacture.
